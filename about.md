Hi, my name is Paul Targo≈Ñski, I'm interested in a lot of things, that have the one common denominator, which is creating. Among them - just to mention digital painting, carpentry and taking care of a small vineyard from which I hope to get the first few bottles of wine this year :)

From the same passion arises a satisfaction from creating modern websites. Since the earliest times, people used the announcements, that were put up on the market, newspaper advertisements, flyers, posters, and a lot of other ways, just to reach the widest possible audience of potential customers, to share their ideas, to announce information or to increase sales.

For this purpose the art of typography and printing was perfected through centuries, but nowadays the possibility of reaching other people have been elevated to a whole new level, impossible to achieve before. Using the Internet, we can not only stay in touch with millions of people around the world but also a range of tools that we can use, is now incredibly rich. We have not only static text, but also subtle animations and transitions that can make reception of content more pleasant experience, regardless of the device that we are using.

I believe that web development is a kind of contemporary craft in the best sense of the word. This is an area that combines past achievements and creates something completely new, and the future can only be more interesting!
